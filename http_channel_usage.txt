Proof of concept usage document

For this covert channel, you will need 3 terminals and to make sure python is installed.

In order to run the http covert channel:

1. in one terminal, run cc_server.py
2. in another terminal, run cc_client.py

This will set up a connection between the client and server and you will be able to see the covert messages
as the server detects and decodes them.

Additionally, if you want to see how normal traffic looks to the server:

3. in a third terminal, run normal_traffic.py
